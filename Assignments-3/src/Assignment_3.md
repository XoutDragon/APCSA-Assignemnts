# Outline of Chapter 2
## Summary

> Software development involves four basic development activities (establishing the requirements. creating a design, implementing the code, and testing the implementation).
> Design: How the program will meet the requirements\
> Algorithm: Written in Pseudocode to help figure out how the code will operate\
> Implementation: Actually writing the code\
> Testing: Making sure everything works\
> 
> if statement checks if something is true or not then executes the code block within\
> 
> Relational Operators: ==, !=\
> 
> Logical Operators: &&(and), ||(or)\
> 
> While Loop: A loop that runs while the condition is true\
> 
> Infinite Loop: Bad (happens when loop never becomes false)\
> 
> Iterator: a method to process a collection of items one at a time
> 
> Scanner object to process input

> **Short Answer**
> 1) If they are equal then it just use that number if it's lower than the third. No it does not.
> 2) There is no need to check if total is less than sum as total can only be 1 number if it is equal to MAX.\
> What can be done is\
> if (total == Max) {System.out.println("total == max and is < sum.");} else {System.out.println("total is not equal to MAX");}
> 3) the equality operator is == not =. Not it will not compile

> 8) It will print out ever even number between and including 0 and 200
> 9) it will print out ever number between 200 and 0 (including them also) that isn't a multiple of 4
> 10) for (int num = 1; num < 20; num++) {System.out.println(num);}
> 11) The loop will never be false which makes it an infinite loop. What can be changed it making count = count + 1 into count = count - 1. Another method is setting count to a negative number or making the while loop condition contain a bigger number than the one stored in count.
> 12) Infinite amount of times because both num and val are increasing at the same rate. 
> 13) boolean check = False; while(!check) {if (num > 0){check=true;} else {num = in.nextInt();}}
> 14) int SENTINEL = 4, input = 0; while(input != SENTINEL) {input = in.nextInt();}
> 15) for (int i = 1; i <= 99; i++) {if (i % 2 != 0){System.out.println(i);}}
> 16) for (int i = 300; i >= 3; i--) {if (i % 3 == 0){System.out.println(i);}}
> 17) int highest = 0; for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {int temp = in.nextInt(); if (temp > highest) {highest = temp;}} System.out.println(highest);
